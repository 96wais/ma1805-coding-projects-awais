Here i found an image and i added it to a website. I also added a big circle to mae it look like a rock. his portfolio project was quite challeneging and probabaly the hardest one of them all in my opinion. Thought this really did teach me alot. I understand how to add images to the website. You paste a website link to the code and add some features in. I also tried to add a sound but unfortunately it did nit work.
