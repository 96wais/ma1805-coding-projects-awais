This was my favouite portfolio project out of all of them. i enjoyed making this specific project alot and i learned alot on how to make glitches, changing the colour an even adding letters to the page. The glitchy letters and the purple background sort of gives a haunted and eerie vibe, which makes it look quite scary. It also looks like someone hacked the website which makes it looks facinating. This was a challenge that i really enjoyed and hopefully i will be able to do this again.
